    This must be admissible and preferably consistent.

    Hints:
    - Use problem.heuristicInfo to cache expensive computations
    - Go with some simple heuristics first, then build up to more complex ones
    - Consider: distance to nearest survivor + MST of remaining survivors
    - Balance heuristic strength vs. computation time (do experiments!)
